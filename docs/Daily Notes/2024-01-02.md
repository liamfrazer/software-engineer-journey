* Process of elimination  - new branch on develop
* Packagelock.json change
	* Only commit changes that I've intentionally done depending on a dependency
	* Change/add/remove - only reason to change the packagelock file
* If I've not intentionally made a change to the packagelock, the file shouldn't be committed
