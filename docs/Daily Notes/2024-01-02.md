* Process of elimination  - new branch on develop
* Packagelock.json change
	* Only commit changes that I've intentionally done depending on a dependency
	* Change/add/remove - only reason to change the packagelock file
* If I've not intentionally made a change to the packagelock, the file shouldn't be committed 


* Deploying the branch to wsc-dev when needing to test before merging with 
* Check previous Builds before I do it, if no recent deploys then my branch can be used


* JSDOCS, when using an object, there should only be one param
* Cherry-pick - really powerful to pull separate commits
