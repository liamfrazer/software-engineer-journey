# Ideas
## Framework Ideas
* Dynamically adjustable car values
* Dynamically adjustable weapon values
* Banking system entirely based on virtual money/offline bank account
* Weapon stat tracking system?
* Food intake/health system?
* "fruit" watch could be used to show you your vitals on screen
* If not admin + check speed over % + in a vehicle = ban/screenshot

## Game Ideas
* Environment is impacted by spells (e.g things set on fire if hit by a fire spell)
* Replace the functionality of a spell with a dino instead
* Weapons that I'm holding (as I can't do much else) could benefit the Dino's powers
* Mining events could take place that I need protection from
* Marketplace would be a website accessible internal + external and be connected to a database both accessible from JS/React & C#
* First mining run gives you a choice? or gives a defined dino
* When entering the mine, you're always put at the first level, but should a choice be provided if multiple levels are accessible?

## Work Ideas
* Manage .MD files within an application, potentially GIT to follow changes?
* The agents shouldn't have to tell OPS what chat they're currently on, we should be able to retrieve that from the MI - Saves asking the question + saves agent time away from the conversation
* Agents should be pingable/alerted whenever there is an urgent message, similar to the functionality of how we're able to alert the customers with urgent messages
*
