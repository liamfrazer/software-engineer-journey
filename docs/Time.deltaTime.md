# Time.deltaTime

![[Pasted image 20240113165926.png]]
* Depending on CPU speed, this changes how quick the `Update()` class runs
* Using `Time.deltaTime`, Unity can tell us how long each frame took to execute
* When we multiply something by `Time.deltaTime`, it makes our game "frame rate independent"
* The game will behave the same on any PC
