# Introduction to Method

```c#
void CleanYourRoom()
{
	Things to do;
}
```

* `void` is the return value - void = return nothing
* `CleanYourRoom` is the function name
* `()` is the parameter - () = nothing required

* We can ask for some information to be RETURNED
* We can specify parameters, which are requirements for the function to run

* Parameter is the argument we would be passing into it
* The return is data we're returning from the function
