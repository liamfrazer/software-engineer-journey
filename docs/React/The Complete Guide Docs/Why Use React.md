# Why Use React

* With React, you define the target UI state or states
* You don't define the steps to get there
* React will figure out & perform the necessary steps

* When writing React code, you're writing code in a Declarative way
* You define the goal, not the steps

* JavaScript is Imperative, you're defining the steps and how to get to the goal
* You're not defining the goal itself
