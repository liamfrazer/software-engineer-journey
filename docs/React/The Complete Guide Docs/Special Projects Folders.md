* JavaScript code, typically uses JSX ("HTML in JavaScript")
* Code is transformed and optimised (e.g unnecessary whitespace is removed)
* Code that runs in the browser (JavaScript code, without JSX)
* The transformation is handled by tools such as CRA & Vite, why we require things such as a build tool
