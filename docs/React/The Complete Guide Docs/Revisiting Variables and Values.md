# Revisiting Variables and Values

* String
* Text values
* Wrapped with single or double quotes
* Can also be created with backticks
```js
"Hello World"
'Liam'
`Hello there`
```

* Number
* Positive or Negative
* With decimal points (float) or without (integer)
```js
5
-23

3.14
-8.12
```

* Boolean
* true or false
* A simple "yes" or "no" value type
* Typically used in conditions
```js
true
false
```

* Null or undefined
* "There is no value"
* undefined: Default if no value was assigned yet
* null: Explicitly assigned by the developer (reset value)

* Variables are data containers
* Variables store a value and can be used as often and in as many places as needed
*
