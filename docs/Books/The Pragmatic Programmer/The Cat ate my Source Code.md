# The Cat ate my Source Code
* Does your excuse sound reasonable? or Stupid?
* How is it going to sound to your boss?
* What is the other person likely to say?
* How will you respond?
* Is there anything else you can try?

* Instead of excuses, provide options
* Explain what can be done to salvage the situation
* Do you need to spend time prototyping to determine the best way to proceed?
* Do you need to introduce better testing, or automation to prevent it from happening again?

* Try to flush out the lame excuses before voicing them aloud.

* If you find yourself saying "I don't know", be sure to follow it up with "but I'll find out"
* It's a great way to admin what you don't know, but then take responsibility like a pro.
