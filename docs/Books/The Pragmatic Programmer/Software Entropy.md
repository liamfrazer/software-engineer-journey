* Don't live with broken windows
* Help strengthen your team by surveying your project neighbourhood.
* Choose two or three broken windows and discuss with your colleagues what the problems are and what could be done to fix them.

* Can you tell when a window first gets broken?
* What is your reaction?
* If it was the result of someone else's decision, or a management edict, what can you do about it?
