# What Makes a Pragmatic Programmer

## Early adapter/fast adapter
* You have an instinct for technologies and techniques and you love trying things out.
* When given something new, you can grasp it quickly and integrate it with the rest of your knowledge.
* Your confidence is born of experience.
## Inquisitive
* You tend to ask ask questions.
* You are a pack rat for little facts, each of which may affect some decsions years later from now

## Critical Thinker
* You rarely take things as given without first getting the facts.
* When colleagues say "because that's the way it's done", or a vendor promises the solution to all your problems, you smell a challenger.

## Realistic
* You try to understand the underlying nature of each problem you face.
* This realism gives you a good feel for how difficult things are, and how long things will take.
* Deeply understanding that process should be a difficult or will take a while to complete gives you the stamina to keep at it.

## Jack of all Trades
* You try hard to be familiar with a broad range of technologies and environments, and you work to keep abreast of new developments.
* Although your current job may require you to be a specialist, you will always be able to move on to new areas and new challenges

## Care about your Craft

## Think about your Work
