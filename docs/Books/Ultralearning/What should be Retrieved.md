# What should be Retrieved
* If you need to recall something later, you're best off practising retrieving it.
* Put more effort into practicing retrieving the underlaying concepts than doing technical calculations.
* Things that are rarely used, or that are easier to look up than memorise won't be retrieved. These tend to be the things that don't matter so much.

* A programmer may realise a need to use a certain function to solve a problem, but forgets how to write it.
* Looking up the syntax may slow down the process, but the problem will still be solved anyway.
* If you don't have enough knowledge stored to recognise when you can use a function to solve your problem, no looking up can help you.

* Often the thing separating mediocre programmers from great ones isn't the range of problems they can solve, but that the latter often knows dozens of ways to solve problems and can select the best one for each situation.
