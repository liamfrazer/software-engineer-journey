2. **Functions:** Learn how to create functions, pass parameters, and return values.
3. **Control Structures:** Master control flow statements like `if...else`, `for` loops, `while` loops, and `switch` statements.
4. **Objects and Arrays:** Explore how to work with objects and arrays, including manipulating and accessing data within them.
5. **Scope and Closures:** Understand the concept of scope, closures, and how they affect variable access.

#### Facts:

1. **Syntax:** Familiarize yourself with JavaScript syntax, including semicolons, brackets, and other language-specific elements.
2. **Built-in Functions:** Know important built-in functions/methods and their usage (e.g., `map()`, `filter()`, `reduce()`).
3. **Event Handling:** Understand how to handle events like clicks, mouse movements, and keyboard events.
4. **Error Handling:** Learn about error types and how to handle exceptions using `try...catch`.

#### Procedures:
