# How to Practice retrieval
* Retrieval not only enhances on what you've learnt previously, but can help prepare you to learn better.
* Retrieval works to enhance future learning, even when there is nothing to retrieve yet.
* Trying to retrieve an answer that doesn't yet exist in your mind, is like laying down a road to a building that hasn't been built yet.

## Tactic 1: Flash Cards
* Flashcards work really well when there is a pairing between a specific queue and a particular response.
* Programmers can memorise syntax via flashcards, but concepts that need to be applied in real programs don't often fit the cue-response framework that flash cards demand.

## Tactic 2: Free Recall
* A simple tactic for applying retrieval is, after reading a section from a book or sitting in a lecture, to try and write down everything you can remember on a blank piece of paper.
* By forcing yourself to recall the main points and arguments, you'll be able to remember them better later.

## Tactic 4: Closed Book Learning
* For a programmer, it's not enough to know what an algorithm means, but to be able to write it in code.
* As you go through passive material, you can create challenges for yourself to go through later.
