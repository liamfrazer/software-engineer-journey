# The Seed
* This is one of the fun parts of a project, because nothing is at stake.
* You get to play with forms and see what takes shape.
* There are no rules.
* Cultivation will look different for every artist and every seed.

* Shakespeare's plays for example, have been adapted into movies centred around everything from New York's street gangs to samurais, from Santa Monica to outer space.

* We generate possibilities instead of eliminating them.

* Consider how many innovations that might have changed the world have been lost because someone was so focused on their goal, they missed the revelation right in front of them.

* When something interesting starts coming together, it arouses delight.
* It's an energising feeling of wanting more.
* A feeling of moving forward.
* Follow that energy.

* Failure is the information you need to get where you're going.
