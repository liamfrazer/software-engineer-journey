# Creating your first CSharp Application
```c#
namespace HelloWorld
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
            Console.ReadLine(); // Wait for further input
        }
    }
}

```
* It matters where you type your code (e.g outside of the code blocks{ })
* A C# instruction has to end with a `;`
* Cannot miss using `"` around a STRING
* C# is case-sensitive, wrong case will cause complications
* Lowercase `readline` is different than `ReadLine`

* Commenting out code to be used for later or write notes regarding the application
