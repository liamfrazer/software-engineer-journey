# While Iteration Statement
* The `while` statement in this scenario is allowing us to check for a condition
* `while` the evaluation is true, we're able to recall the `MainMenu()` method
* `while` the evaluation is false, we're able to break out of the while statement

* The `do while` statement allows us to run the `do` part of the statement atleast one time
