# Defining and Calling Methods
* A method is a block of code, we can then call it by it's name to invoke that code defined within it's codeblock

```c#
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            HelloWorld();
        }

        private static void HelloWorld()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Hello world!");
        }
```
* Simplest example of show how to create and call a method
