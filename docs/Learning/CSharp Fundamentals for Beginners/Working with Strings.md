# Working with Strings

* `\` can be used to escape sequences into literal strings
* `\n` can be used to create a new line
* `\\` can be used to use an actual \ within the string, escaping it immediately
* `@` in front of the string ensures C# understands we want to use the \\ characters
* `{0}` can be used as replacement code to be replaced by a value at the end of the string
* `{O:C}` will be replaced with a currency value
* `{0:N}` will add in decimal points and commas to show a number in an easier to read format
