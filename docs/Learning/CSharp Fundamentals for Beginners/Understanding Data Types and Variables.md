# Understanding Data Types and Variables

* We have to declare the variables (buckets) and then label them to ensure we can access them.

```c#
            int x;
            int y;
```
* Assigning integer values into the variables `x` and `y`

```c#
            int x;
            int y;

            x = 7;
            y = x + 3;
```
* Using the `=` assignment operator, assigning a value into the Y variable
