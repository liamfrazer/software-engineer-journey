# Introduction to Classes

* Classes are used to organise our code
* Classes are "containers" for variables and methods that allow us to group similar things together
* Usually we aim for a class to do one main thing and not multiple things
	* Easier to read our code
	* Easier to fix issues
	* Easier to have multiple people work on a project

* We tend to create a new class each time we create a new script
	* Movement
	* CollisionHandler
	* Shooting
	* Scoring
	* EnemyAI

## Encapsulating our Code
* "need to know" level of access
* E.g Don't let everything access everything else
* Only methods in our Movement class can alter our player's movement speed


## Classes already built for us
* Unity has many classes already created
* We write the class name then use the dot operator to access things within that class
*
