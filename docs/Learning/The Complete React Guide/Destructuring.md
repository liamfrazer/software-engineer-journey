# Destructuring

* On the right side, they will create a new array
* On the left side, they will destructure the array
```js
const [] = ["Liam", "Frazer"];
```

* The [] syntax can be used to pull values out of an array.

```js
const [firstName, lastName] = ["Liam", "Frazer"];
console.log(firstName, lastName)
```

* The destructuring syntax also exists for objects, it doesn't just exist for arrays.
