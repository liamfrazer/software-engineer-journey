# Vanilla CSS in React

## Advantages
* CSS code is decoupled from JSX code
* You write CSS code as you know and (maybe) love it
* CSS code can be written by another developer who needs only a minimal amount of access to your JSX code

## Disadvantages
* You need to know CSS
* CSS code is not scoped to components
* CSS rules may clash across components
* E.g. Same CSS class name used in different components for different purposes
