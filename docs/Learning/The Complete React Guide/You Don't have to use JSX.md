# You Don't have to use JSX
1. React Code
	1. The React code you write and test
2. Build Process
	1. Changes and optimizes your code
	2. Transforms it such that it runs in the browser
	3. Also, potentially optimises other assets like CSS & image files
3. Deployable files
	1. A collection of generated files that include your optimised code and any other extra assets

* In theory, React doesn't need JSX, but the vast majority will use JSX and a build process
