# Creating Components
* Reusable Building Blocks
	* Create small building blocks & compose the UI from them
	* If needed, reuse a building block in different parts of the UI
* Related Coder Lives Together
	* Related HTML & JS & CSS code is stored together
	* Since JS influences the output, storing JS and HTML together makes sense
* Separation of Concerns
	* Different components handle different data & logic
	* Vastly simplifies the process of working on complex apps


## Describe the target UI with JSX
* JavaScript Syntax Extension
* Used to describe & create HTML elements in JavaScript in a declarative way.
* With React, you write declarative code
* You define the target HTML structure  & UI, not the steps to get there
* Browsers do not support JSX
* React projects come with a build process that transforms JSX
