# Special Projects Folders

* JavaScript code, typically uses JSX ("HTML in JavaScript")
* Code is transformed and optimised (e.g unnecessary whitespace is removed)
* Code that runs in the browser (JavaScript code, without JSX)
* The transformation is handled by tools such as CRA & Vite, why we require things such as a build tool

* The code you write is not the code that gets executed in the browser
* Your code is transformed before it's handed off to the browser

* Raw, unprocessed React code won't execute in the browser, as React uses JSX
* JSX is not a default JavaScript feature

* The code would not be optimised for production(e.g. not minified)
* React projects require a build process that transforms your code
