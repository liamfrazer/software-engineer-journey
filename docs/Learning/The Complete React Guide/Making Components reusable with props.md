# Making Components reusable with props

* Main advantage of components is that they're reusable
* You can reuse React components, but you don't have to.

* Like we can use functions with different data, we can also use components with different data


* React allows you to pass data to components via a concept called `Props`

* JSX Code that uses a Component > Set Props > Component > Receive Props > Component Function

* JSX Code that uses a Component
	* Set component input data via "custom HTML attributes (props)"
* Component
	* Defines internal logic + JSX code that should be rendered
* Component Function
	* Receives props with parameter with configuration data
