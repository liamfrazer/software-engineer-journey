# The Mindset of Experimentation
* In a growth mindset, learners see their own capacity for learning as something that can be actively improved upon.
* Those who think they can improve and grow, do.

* Copying simplifies the problem of experimentation somewhat as it gives you a starting point for making decisions.
* In attempting to emulate or copy an example you appreciate, you must deconstruct it to understand why it works.
