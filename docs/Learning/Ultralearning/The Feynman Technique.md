# The Feynman Technique
* The purpose of using this technique is to help develop intuition about the ideas you are learning.
* It can be used when you don't understand an idea at all, or simply when you understand something a little, but really want to turn it into deep intuition.

## 1.  Write down the concept or problem you want to understand at the top of a piece of paper.
## 2. In the space below, explain the idea as if you had to teach it to someone else.
### A) If it's a concept, ask yourself how you would convey the idea to someone who has never heard of it before.
### B) If it's a problem, explain how to solve it and -crucially- why the solution procedure makes sense to you.
## 3. When you get stuck, meaning your understanding fails to provide a clear answer, go back to your book, notes, teacher or reference material to find the answer.

* Using this technique will quickly reveal how much you really understand of your subject.
*  Any gaps in your understanding will become clear as you struggle to explain key parts of the idea.
