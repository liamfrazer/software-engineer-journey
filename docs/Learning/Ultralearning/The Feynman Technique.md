# The Feynman Technique
* The purpose of using this technique is to help develop intuition about the ideas you are learning.
* It can be used when you don't understand an idea at all, or simply when you understand something a little, but really want to turn it into deep intuition.
* Names do not constitute knowledge

1. Write down the subject you want to study.
2. Write down your explanation of the subject, as if writing it for a child
3. Identify the gaps you have in the topic
	1. Do you ramble?
	2. Can you not use simple language?
	3. Strengthen your weak areas
4. Repeat Step 1-3 until you've mastered the subject

## 1.  Write down the concept or problem you want to understand at the top of a piece of paper.
## 2. In the space below, explain the idea as if you had to teach it to someone else.
### A) If it's a concept, ask yourself how you would convey the idea to someone who has never heard of it before.
### B) If it's a problem, explain how to solve it and -crucially- why the solution procedure makes sense to you.
## 3. When you get stuck, meaning your understanding fails to provide a clear answer, go back to your book, notes, teacher or reference material to find the answer.

* Using this technique will quickly reveal how much you really understand of your subject.
*  Any gaps in your understanding will become clear as you struggle to explain key parts of the idea.

### Application 1:  For things you don't understand at all
* Easy method is with book in hand, go back and forth between your explanation and the one in the book.
### Application 2: For Problems You Can't Seem to Solve
* It's very important to go through the problem step by step rather than simply summarising it.
* Summarising may skip out the core difficulties of the problem.
* Going deeper may take time, but it can help you get a strong grasp over a new method in one go.
### Application 3: For Expanding Your Intuition
