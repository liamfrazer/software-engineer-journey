# Tactics for Designing Drills

## Tactic 1: Drill Slicing
* The easiest way to create a drill is to isolate a slice in time of a longer sequence of actions.
* Looks for parts of a skill you're learning to decompose into specific moments of time that have heightened difficulty or importance.
## Tactic 5: Prerequisite Chaining
* Start with a skill that you don't have all the prerequisites for
* Then when you perform poorly, go back a step, learn one of the foundational topics and then repeat the exercise.


* Instead of being forced to do this for an unknown process, it is now up t you to find a way to enhance the learning process by accelerating learning on the specific things that you found most difficult
*
