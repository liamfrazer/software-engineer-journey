# Why is it so hard to remember things
* Programmers must remember the syntax for commands in their code
* Being able to remember how something works, or how to perform a particular technique is useless if you cannot recall it
* The forgetting curve, we tend to forget things incredibly quickly after learning them
* If you're learning programming, you may learn what a `for loop` is and remember it in terms of doing something repeatedly. Later you may learn about `while loops`, `recursion`, `repeat-until loops` and `go-to` statements. Each of these are related to doing something repeatedly, but may impact your ability to remember how to use a `for loop`
* You need to pick a mnemonic system, which will both accomodate your goals and be simple enough to stick to.
* Some subjects allow for some degree of forgetting as long as the skills are practiced
