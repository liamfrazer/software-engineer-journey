# Why is it so hard to remember things
* Programmers must remember the syntax for commands in their code
* Being able to remember how something works, or how to perform a particular technique is useless if you cannot recall it
* The forgetting curve, we tend to forget things incredibly quickly after learning them
* If you're learning programming, you may learn what a `for loop` is and remember it in terms of doing something repeatedly. Later you may learn about `while loops`, `recursion`, `repeat-until loops` and `go-to` statements. Each of these are related to doing something repeatedly, but may impact your ability to remember how to use a `for loop`
* You need to pick a mnemonic system, which will both accomplish your goals and be simple enough to stick to.
* Some subjects allow for some degree of forgetting as long as the skills are practiced continuously and have the ability to relearn.
* All systems work according to one of the four mechanisms: spacing, proceduralization, over-learning or mnemonics

## Mechanism 1 - Spacing: Repeat to Remember
* Don't cram. Spreading learning sessions over more intervals over longer periods of time tend to perform much better in the long run.
* Many ultralearners apply what are known as SRS tools to retain the most knowledge with the least effort.
* Semi-regular do fresher projects. Scheduling this kind of maintenance in advance can be helpful, teaches that learning isn't just done once and continues for life.

## Mechanism 3- Overlearning: Practice Beyond Perfect
* Can recall programming from the MI challenges, because they happened to be patterns that were repeated far more than was necessary to perform them adequately at the time > Because they were components of a much larger problem
* This suggests that moving up a level to a more advanced skill enabled the earlier skill to be overlearned, thus preventing some forgetting.
