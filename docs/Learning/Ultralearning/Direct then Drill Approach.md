# Direct then Drill Approach
* The first step is try to practice the skill directly.
*  This means figuring out where and how the skill will be used, then trying to match the situation as close as is feasible.
* Learn programming by writing software.
* Improve your writing skills by penning essays.
* This initial connection and subsequent feedback loop ensure that the transfer problem wont occur.

* The next step is to analyse the direct skill and try to isolate components that are either rate-determing steps in your performance or subskills you find difficult to improve because there are too many other things going on for you to focus on them.

* The final step is to go back to direct practice and integrate what you've learnt.
