# Experimentation is Key to Mastery
* Learning in the early phases of a skill is accumulation.
* You acquire new facts, knowledge and skills to handle problems you didn't know how to solve before. 
* Getting better increasingly becomes an act of unlearning.
* Not only must you learn to solve problems you couldn't before, you must unlearn stale and ineffective approaches for solving these problems.
