# The Feynman Technique

* Choose the concept you want to understand Â 
* Take a blank piece of paper, write the name of that concept at the top of the page
* Explain the idea to yourself as if you were teaching it to someone who does not understand it at all 
* Whenever you get stuck, go back to the reference material, lectures or a teacher assistant and re-read or re-learn the material until you get it enough that you can explain it on the paper
* Whenever you write down a wordy or a confusing explanation for something, try either to simplify the language, or create an analogy to understand it better 
* If you want to understand something even better or remember it even better, further try to develop, simplify and improve the explanation)
* A good self-test of what you've learned is to go through your technique without looking at any reference material at any point and see if you can explain it deeply)
