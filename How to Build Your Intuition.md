# How to Build Your Intuition
* Instead of following an equation, he would try to imagine the situation it described.
* As more information was given, he'd work it through on his example
* Whenever there was a mistake, he could see it.
* Constructed something which fit all the condition, as soon as something doesn't fit, then it's false.

* This approach is more succesfull in solving problems, because it gets to the core of how the problem works. The surface features of the problem don't always relate to the correct procedures needed to solve it.
* Only by developing enough experience with problem solving can you build up a deep mental model of how other problems work.

## Rule 1: Don't give up on a hard problem
* when you feel like giving up and that you can't possibly figure out the solution to a difficult problem, try setting a timer for another ten minutes to push yourself a bit further.
* Even when the difficulty is caused by the information not being there, this can prime you to remember information better later.
## Rule 2: Prove things to understand them
* Feynman didn't master things by following along with other people's results. Instead, it was the process of mentally trying to re-create those results that became so good.
* His drive to understand things by virtue of working through the results himself also assisted in building his capacity for deep intuition.
